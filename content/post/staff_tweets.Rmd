I wanted to see how active campaign staffers are on social media. Looking at only the communications and press staff of candidates who particpated in NBC's debate  on Nov 21, I considered their twitter presence on debate day.


[This](https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election_key_staffers,_2020) is the list I used to get staffers' Twitter handles. All of the candidates have two communications/press staffers, except Booker who has three, and Biden who has four. 

Yang and Gabbard actually each have one comms staffer, but Yang's hasn't tweeted since June, and Gabbard's hasn't tweeted since August. So they don't show up for the rest of my analysis.

Here are the findings: 
```{r, eval = F}
# I suppose you can only pull tweets from the past week :( I should have cached the api chunk, and/or saved the df. I saved the image from the last time I ran this. So that's all I can use, for now. But below is how I made it:

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(rtweet)
library(readr)

# Setup twitter access
appname <- "staffscrape"
key <- "RTiH1TQcJLP4O8cYjlRuwZKe4"
secret <- "9vgduSJISaYTQ23IdVgkPVh9wVmAzW3leqSjKAco73q1gfK7Yg"
access_token <- "1197145858829099008-Nnw1OqbF1ZfCvW08fUtQtditmTWaTI"
access_secret <- "JnIeiD5RHrSnVSq8JRJpK5PMF6qGFN1S8LSZkuUUgRXoM"

twitter_token <- create_token(
  app = appname,
  consumer_key = key,
  consumer_secret = secret,
  access_token = access_token,
  access_secret = access_secret)

# Get our list of handles (from ballotpedia)
full <- read_csv("~/Documents/Coding/data_blog/data/full_staffers.csv") %>%
  mutate(Handle = str_replace_all(Handle, "@", "")) %>%
  filter(Handle != "N/A")
         
comms <- read_csv("comms_staffers.csv") %>%
  mutate(Handle = str_replace_all(Handle, "@", "")) %>%
  filter(Handle != "N/A")

# Get all original tweets from debate day, 11/21/2019
tweets <- get_timeline(user = comms$Handle, 
                       n = 1000) %>%
  mutate(date = substr(as.character(created_at), 1, 10)) %>%
  filter(date == "2019-11-21") %>%
  select(c(screen_name, 
           text, 
           is_quote, 
           is_retweet,
           favorite_count,
           retweet_count)) %>%
   mutate(tweet_id = 1:nrow(df)) 

# Merge back with comms df to find corresponding candidate
df <- inner_join(comms, tweets, by = c("Handle" = "screen_name"))

# New df with 1)candidate name 2)#tweets 3)#favorited 4)#retweeted
summdf <- df %>% 
  group_by(Candidate) %>%
  summarize(tweets = n(),
            favorited = sum(favorite_count),
            retweeted = sum(retweet_count))

# Time 2 plot
plot_tweets <- summdf %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Candidate)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = tweets), stat = "identity") +
  labs(y = "# tweets",
       x = "")

plot_retweets <- summdf %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Candidate)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = retweeted), stat = "identity")  + 
  labs(y = "# retweets",
       x = "")

plot_favs <- summdf %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Candidate)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = favorited), stat = "identity") + 
  labs(y = "# favorites",
       x = "")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(plot_tweets, 
                        plot_retweets,
                        plot_favs,
                        nrow = 3)

```

Apparently, Biden's team of four couldn't keep up with any of the others. The 53 tweets his team did get out on debate day didn't manage to gain much traction. Klobuchar and Warren's situations were similar.

Booker's team, on the other hand, was pretty active on Twitter that day. But despite the volume, they didn't gain much traction either. 

Sanders experience the opposite: low-activity but high visibility.

Harris's team's Twitter game was strongest, as was her traction.
